    "I have two files, \"master.csv\" and \"data.csv\".\n",

    "\n",
    "data.csv has like 4 columns of data, starting with the same \"stu_number\", then adding other columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "I need a script to loop through the data.csv file and compare that the stu_number is in the \"master.csv\" file. If the stu_number is also in the 'master' file, then we consider it valid and print out that row of data to an 'output.csv' file. The output file is essentially a list of rows from the data file that match the stu_number. For matching, I'm looking to see if the stu_number exists in both files, and I don't care if a match is on row 100 or row 200. This is why doing a simple 'diff' won't help.\n",

    "Output.csv file: 1234, blah1, blah2, blah 3 1235, blah1, blah2, blah 3\n",

    "I could (in theory) pump this into MySQL and import / select on a join and dump it back to CSV, but that seems like 3 steps too many. I was hoping I could do this in Python.\n",
